# Intro
Disclaimer: I do not give any investment advice. Bear your own risk!

This repository aims to create financial valuation using discounted cash flow analysis. Use this for your own or your company purposes. Hopefully y'all can make money from this and get rich.

For detailed documentation, go to the [wiki page](https://github.com/ledwindra/discounted-cash-flow/wiki).

Following are some general ideas regarding discounted cash flow analysis and equity valuation:

# Clone Repository

Run the following the your command line terminal:

```
cd ~
mkdir github-repository
cd ./github-repository
git clone https://github.com/ledwindra/discounted-cash-flow.git
cd ./discounted-cash-flow
```

You can change ```~``` if you want to locate this directory in another folder and remove ```mkdir github-repository```. Basically this will suffice:

```
git clone https://github.com/ledwindra/discounted-cash-flow.git
```

# Installation
Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) if you haven't. This has only been tested using Python 3.7.3. But it should be fine as long as it is Python 3. I won't bother using Python 2.x because it will stop the [support](https://pythonclock.org/) by 1 January 2020. After installing Anaconda, you need to install the requirements by running the following in your command prompt or terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Notes
Honestly there is nothing new in this analysis, methodologically speaking. You can refer to the notebook for the theoretical background, supported by other references that you may find anywhere. However, should you have any inquiry or criticism, drop me an [email](mailto:lukman.edwindra@gmail.com). Hope you enjoy this!
